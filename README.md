A Barista POS app

How It's Made:
Utilized:

JavaScript
Node
Express
EJS
CSS(flexbox & bootstrap)
MongoDB
Users(employees) can log on to check orders and completed orders. completed orders names will be read off.
Lessons Learned:
Through building this app, I was able to further strengthen my abilities with CRUD applications. I was also able to work on my CSS by styiling it out rather than using a template.

Optimizations
CSS can be tweaked more to make the site a little more crisp. maybe larger icons and text.

Installation
Clone repo
run npm install
Usage
run node server.js
Navigate to localhost:8080
